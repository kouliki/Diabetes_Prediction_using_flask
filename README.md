Project Overview:-

The Diabetes Prediction Project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on health data such as blood pressure,
glucose levels, and other features. This project aims to provide accurate predictions to help healthcare professionals in their diagnostic process.


Data:-

The dataset used in this project is from [source] and contains information such as:

1. Age
2. Blood pressure
3. Glucose levels
4. Body mass index (BMI)
5. Insulin levels
6. Skin thickness
7. Diabetes pedigree function
8. Outcome (diabetes or not)
